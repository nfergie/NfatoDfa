# NfatoDfa
This project contains code that translates a Non-deterministic Finite Automata(NFA) into a Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA).

## Requirements
This project requires an input file as CMD line argument. 

This file will have the form:
Line 1: A list of states, Q, separated by tabs.
Line 2: A list of the symbols in Σ, separated by tabs. The string E
will not be explicitly included.
Line 3: The start state, q0 ∈ Q.
Line 4: The set of accept states, F , separated by tabs

A sample input file can be found [here]()

## Output
The
